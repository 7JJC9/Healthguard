Project Abstract: Disease Prediction System

This mini project is a web-based application developed using React for the frontend and Python (Django REST API) for the backend, with  PostgreSQL as the database. The system is designed to predict the likelihood of a disease based on user-provided medical data, helping users and healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and timely intervention.

Key Features:

    • User input of symptoms or health parameters (age, weight, medical history, etc.)
    • Machine Learning-based prediction of potential diseases
    • Clean and responsive interface using React and Bootstrap

Objective:

The primary goal of this project is to build an intelligent, easy-to-use system that assists users in understanding their health conditions and potential risks, supporting preventive healthcare measures.

Technology Stack:

    • Frontend: React,js, HTML5, Bootstrap 5
    • Backend: Python (Django REST Framework)
    • Database: PostgreSQL
    • ML Integration: Python libraries such as scikit-learn



Project Modules

        ◦ User registration and login/logout
        ◦ Role-based access (Admin/User)

    2. Symptom Input Module
    
        ◦ Form to input personal details and symptoms
        ◦ Validation of input data

    3. Disease Prediction Module
    
        ◦ Uses trained ML models for prediction
        ◦ Returns probability or risk score for each disease
        ◦ Display prediction results clearly
